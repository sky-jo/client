This is my first attempt at creating a web app with the MERN stack

I think it's pretty cool, you can lookup stats of NBA players. You can check out some components I made in the src directory. 

This is under continuous development and I have some feature that I plan to implement in the future (i.e. when im not drowning in schoolwork).

Current Features:

- filtering players by min and max PPG, APG, RPG, or Team Name.
- changing the order the players are filtered in by stats or name.

Features I Would Like to Add:

- adding filters for defensive stats
- adding a player comparison feature
- adding a trade evaluation feature
